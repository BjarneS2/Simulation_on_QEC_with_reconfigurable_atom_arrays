# QEC-Simulation-on-reconfigurable-atom-arrays
Simulating some results of the paper 'Logical quantum processor based on reconfigurable atom arrays' (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06927-3).

Feel free to browse through the Jupyter notebook `test.ipynb` to see how the simulations are set up and run. The main code for the surface code implementation can be found in `surface_code.py` and `MultiSurfaceCode.py`.
